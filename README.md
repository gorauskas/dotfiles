# Dot Files

These are my public dotfiles and they are guaranteed to work for me... Feel free
to steal them, but your mileage may vary. My emacs related files are in a
different repository.

## If you are running Linux/Unix:

- Git clone this `dotfiles` repo right into your home directory and run
  `deploy.sh`. This operation will create symlinks in your home directory that
  point to the files in this directory.
- Install Linux Logo if you want to display a cool logo on your terminal
- This is all you have to do to deploy it on Linux.

## Optional Requeriments

- [Linux logo](http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/linux_logo/)


Have lots of fun!
