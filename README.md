# Dot Files

These are my public dotfiles and they are guaranteed to work for me... Feel
free to steal them, but your mileage may vary.

My emacs related files are in a different repository.

## If you are running Linux/Unix:

- Ignore the keyboard.reg file, which is a Windows registry hack to swap the
  CapsLock and left Ctrl keys. You can do this by configuring your desktop of
  choice.

## If you're running Windows:

- Use the _vimrc file instead of .vimrc
- Copy the .vim directory to your default user folder. Rename it to vimfiles.
- If you want to swap the Caps Lock and Ctrl keys then merge the keyboard.reg
  file into the registry (reboot required).
- All bash related files are known to work on Cygwin bash on my machine. ;)
