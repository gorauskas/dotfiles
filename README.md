# Dot Files

These are my public dotfiles and they are guaranteed to work for me... Feel free
to steal them, but your mileage may vary. My emacs related files are in a
different repository.

## If you are running Linux/Unix:

- Git clone this `dotfiles` repo right into your home directory and run
  `deploy.sh`. This operation will create symlinks in your home directory that
  point to the files in this directory.
- Install Linux Logo if you want to display a cool logo on your terminal
- This is all you have to do to deploy it on Linux.

## If you're running Windows:

- All bash related files are known to work on Cygwin bash in Windows 7 or
  above.
- If you are using something like sygwin on windows.
- Use the _vimrc file instead of .vimrc
- Copy the .vim directory to your default user folder. Rename it to vimfiles.
- Use the keyboard.reg file, which is a Windows registry hack, to swap the
  CapsLock and left Ctrl keys.
